1. Yes, I was successful in coding non-repititive sections of logic like ruler, board, player position, etc. At first, I just hard printed them and ran the project, but later I found out that they all need to be recurring after each prompt for next move. Also, it was not possible to code them directly, so I first wrote down the conditions and tried to write the code in my notebook. Then, after 2 or 3 attempts, I successfully completed coding them.

2. Structures have made this code a lot easier for me because without structures, I would have to use a lot of variables to represent the same object, making my code more complex and hard to understand. 
For example, to gather the Player configuration and store them, I would have to make a different array like playersymbol and each time I prompt for it, its value will be replaced and in order to cope up with that, I would end up making multiple variables.

3.
do
{
   for (i = 1; i <= Game.pathLength; i++){

       if(i % 10 == 0){

       }
       else{
      
       }
   }
}while(movesRemaining >= 0 && livesRemaining >= 0);
